# MTRX2700 Treasure Hunt Project üîç

## Overview

This project is an interactive treasure hunt challenge built around three STM32F3 Discovery boards working in tandem. The system is modular and incorporates:
- A **claw mechanism** for object retrieval
- A **controller module** with tilt-based input, lidar for the z axis and a button to open and close the claw
- An **IR sensor array** for detecting if the blocks are placed in the right place.

The system has been designed for modularity with each module working independent.

The STM32 boards communicate using a custom binary serialization protocol over UART, with each board handling a specific subsystem. This README outlines how to set up and integrate the system, as well as a breakdown of each module's functionality.

## System Architecture

```
Submodule 1:
[Controller STM32] <-UART-> [Claw STM32]

Submodule 2:
[GUI computer] <-UART-> [IR STM32]
```


Both submodules share a common ground reference. Each board uses a structured packet-based protocol to communicate with the other.

## Module Breakdown

### 1. Claw Board (Claw STM32)
This board handles all claw actuation via stepper motors. It implements:
- Stepper control via timer interrupts
- Position-based or velocity-based movement
- Homing logic with limit switches
- Serial command interface to receive motion commands

**Key files:**
- `stepper.c/h` ‚Äì Handles motion profiles and step generation
- `command_parser.c/h` ‚Äì Parses incoming commands and updates state
- `servo.c/h` ‚Äì Handles the servo motor control

**Inputs:**
- Target velocity from Controller board
- Claw open and close commands

**Outputs:**
- Position reached or movement status

### 2. Controller/Tilt Board (Controller STM32)
This board serves as the input device and human interface. It includes:
- Gyroscope/accelerometer (IMU) for tilt-based control
- Optional button inputs
- Packets containing directional velocity or absolute target positions

**Key functions:**
- Reads and calibrates IMU input
- Converts orientation to movement commands
- Sends velocity commands as packets to the Claw board

**Outputs:**
- `vx`, `vy` values sent as velocity indices (0‚Äì99)
- Optional state bits (e.g. button pressed)

### 3. IR Sensor Board (IR STM32)
This board monitors proximity using a bank of IR reflectance sensors. It implements:
- Analog reads via ADC
- Thresholding to detect object presence or wall-following
- Sends discrete detection events or sensor arrays to other boards

**Outputs:**
- Bitfield indicating which IR sensors are triggered
- Optional angle or position offset data

## Packet Protocol

All boards communicate via a custom binary packet structure.

### Packet Header Format:
```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t sentinel1;     // 0xAA
    uint8_t sentinel2;     // 0x55
    uint16_t message_type; // e.g. 0x0001 for velocity, 0x0002 for status
    uint16_t data_length;  // Length of payload in bytes
} Header;
```

### Example Payloads:
- **Velocity Command:** Two `int8_t` values for `vx` and `vy`, plus a `uint8_t` speed index
- **Claw Position:** `int16_t` target position
- **IR Status:** `uint8_t` array of active sensor bits

The packet is transmitted in the following order:
1. 6-byte header
2. Data payload of `data_length` bytes

A central parsing function waits for the sentinel pair (0xAA, 0x55), reads the header, then dispatches the payload to the appropriate handler.

## Integration Tips

- **Synchronization:** Ensure each STM32 uses the same UART baud rate (typically 115200).
- **Testing:** Each board can be run standalone using test harnesses (e.g. send static packets from a PC).
- **Debugging:** Use serial print or logic analyzers to monitor UART lines during integration.
- **Modularity:** All interface logic is kept in dedicated modules (`serialise.c`, `stepper.c`, etc.) for portability.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement checksum or CRC in packets for error detection.
- Introduce handshaking to confirm receipt of critical commands.
- Add GUI-based dashboard for real-time debugging and visualization.
- Replace fixed baud rate with dynamic negotiation or configuration over serial.
- Improve modularity by allowing runtime registration of message handlers.
- Expand to wireless UART or BLE for remote input/control.
